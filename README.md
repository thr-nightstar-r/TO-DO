# TO-DO List Web App

A simple and interactive To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, check off, and remove tasks, with data persistence using the browser's localStorage.

## Features

- Remove tasks by clicking the delete (×) button
- Tasks are saved in your browser and persist after refresh

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter a task in the input box and press Enter or click the add button (if available).
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed.
4. Click the × icon next to a task to delete it.
